# Blogging Website

Welcome to the repository for my blogging website! This project is built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) and utilizes the **Material-UI (MUI)** library for styling. The website currently allows users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts. However, the update and delete functionalities are not yet authenticated. This feature will be implemented in **Version 2** of the project.
